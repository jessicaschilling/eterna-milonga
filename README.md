# eterna-milonga: Eterna Milonga

## Watch this space
This is a new project. I'm homebound during the pandemic, so want to do something that teaches me some new stuff but also makes other homebound tanguer@s (aka Argentine tango dancers) happy in the meantime.

## The plan

- [x] Distill my last 10+ years' archives of milonga/encuentro/festival playlists into known-good tango tracks
- [x] Put those into a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jngt-ChzwgPwuPkv4jmfI781nqLGEg2UC7Ef8NS_eBg/edit?usp=sharing) and pull out the singer, orquesta, year, dance style, etc for future databasin'
- [x] Query the Spotify API to get the Spotify URI references for each of those tracks
- [x] Pseudocode the [logic](https://github.com/jessicaschilling/eterna-milonga/issues/2) for building tandas that obey the basics of The Tango Rulesâ„¢
- [x] Pseudocode the [logic](https://github.com/jessicaschilling/eterna-milonga/issues/3) for building those tandas into milonga-length playlists that keep orquestas sanely spaced
- [ ] Figure out the best means for getting abovementioned spreadsheet into ... some kind of relational database ... that will both be germane to this project and will teach me things I can use later
- [ ] Real-code the tanda logic (output just as a list of Spotify URIs)
- [ ] Real-code the playlist logic (output just as a list of Spotify URIs)
- [ ] Learn how to feed Spotify a list of URIs and get a playlist back in return
- [ ] Build a UI for this thing: push a button, get a playlist built in your personal Spotify account
- [ ] Add a pref: three- or four-song tango tandas?
- [ ] Add a pref: three- or four-song vals tandas?
- [ ] Add a pref: cortinas, y/n?
- [ ] Add a pref: choose a playlist length
- [ ] Add a pref: choose a cortina (specific track, or maybe just genre)
